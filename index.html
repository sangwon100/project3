		<h2>Professional resume</h2>
		<p>The international school I attended in China had a separate class to learn Chinese. The class was hosted by a Chinese teacher who spoke English. The way to learn Chinese was very different from learning English or Korean. Usually, when I learn a language, I start learning letters, but when I learn Chinese, I start with basic sentences. For example, the structure of sentences I learned was mostly sentences with subject and verbs. I learned that pronunciation is very important when I learn Chinese, so I focused a lot on pronunciation when I speak. Pronunciation is very important since it can change the meaning of the word. For example, The word 'chong' has two meanings. One means 'bug' and the other means 'pick'. The pronunciation of the two words is similar, but the tone of the word "bug" goes up, but the tone of the word "pick" is constant. Even if I focused on pronunciation, there was something else I should focus on. They are Chinese characters. There were many kinds of letters and each letter was very difficult to memorize. I also had a hard time memorizing words, because I could not memorize them perfectly and got low grades because of them. This is the way I had a hard time studying and my Chinese grade plummeted to D. To be honest, it was fortunate that it wasn't an F, but a D was also very low, so I had to raise it unconditionally. Finally, the Chinese grade that started with D could end with B. What I felt while studying is that it is important to listen to the class hard, but I think it is also important to review after the class. So now I have made a habit of reviewing at this college. Especially, I focus more and review more subjects which the first content is very important, such as math. Especially, math becomes very difficult to understand the process that is left behind if you miss the first course. So I always reviewed the course for at least an hour after the math class. So I was able to maintain my A grade.</p> 
		<p>Also, I have been interested in coding since junior high school. Of course, I didn't know anything about coding at the time, but one day a friend suggested that we start a coding club together, and I thought it was a good opportunity, so I accepted the offer. The friend who suggested it to me was a friend who was good at coding at a professional level, and slowly taught the club members the basics of coding. The first thing we learned was Python. After learning to print sentences, I later learned a little more in-depth process. After all, at the club exhibition, we made and displayed a Christmas tree shape with coding. The shape was a little vague, but I decided to be satisfied with it. Then, based on these lessons, I made my major as I.T.</p>

		<p>This is my high school mark. According to the current news, I heard that the school is difficult to operate because the number of students has drastically decreased due to the corona virus and there is a shortage of freshmen.
